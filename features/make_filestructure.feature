Feature: Make a Filestructure of a program
  In order to make creating a filestructure easy
  As a Developer
  I need to be able to have a tool that creates the filestructure with a simple dsl

  Scenario: Developer creates a single directory
    Given that a directory named index does not exist
    When directory('index') is invoked
    Then a folder named index should be created
    And I should see 'created index/'

  Scenario: Developer creates a file
    Given that a file named myfile does not exist
    When file('index') is invoked
    Then a file named index should be created
    And I should see 'created file'
  
  Scenario: Developer creates a file from an erb template
    Given the following erb template named classy
      """
      class <%= params[:name] %>
        def initialize
        end
      end
      """
    When I create a file named classy from the template
    Then I should see the following generate file
      """
      class Classy
        def initialize
        end
      end
      """

  Scenario: Developer creates a nested directory stucture
    Given that the following directories do not exist
      |dirname|
      |root|
      |root/app|
    When I create them using the specified dsl
      |dirname|
      |root|
      |root/app|
    Then I should see the root and root/app directories
